# Distributed version of the Spring PetClinic Sample Application built with Spring Cloud for Kubernetes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) [![Dependency Status](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/58b2c56f9ceb450031272d6a/badge.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/58b2c56f9ceb450031272d6a)

This microservices branch was initially derived from [AngularJS version](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular1) to demonstrate how to split sample Spring application into [microservices](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html). To achieve that goal we used [Spring Cloud Netflix](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix) technology stack.

## Starting services locally without Docker
Every microservice is a Spring Boot application and can be started locally using IDE or `mvn spring-boot:run` command. Please note that supporting services (Config and Discovery Server) must be started before any other application (Customers, Vets, Visits and API).
Tracing server and Admin server startup is optional.
If everything goes well, you can access the following services at given location:
* Discovery Server - http://localhost:8761
* Config Server - http://localhost:8888
* AngularJS frontend (API Gateway) - http://localhost:8080
* Customers, Vets and Visits Services - random port, check Eureka Dashboard 
* Tracing Server (Zipkin) - http://localhost:9411/zipkin/
* Admin Server (Spring Boot Admin) - http://localhost:9090

You can tell Config Server to use your local Git repository by using `local` Spring profile and setting
`GIT_REPO` environment variable, for example:
`-Dspring.profiles.active=local -DGIT_REPO=/projects/spring-petclinic-microservices-config`

## Starting services locally with docker-compose
In order to start entire infrastructure using Docker, you have to build images by executing `mvn clean install -PbuildDocker` 
from a project root. Once images are ready, you can start them with a single command
`docker-compose up`. Containers startup order is coordinated with [`wait-for-it.sh` script](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it). 
After starting services it takes a while for API Gateway to be in sync with service registry,
so don't be scared of initial Zuul timeouts. You can track services availability using Eureka dashboard
available by default at http://localhost:8761.

*NOTE: Under MacOSX or Windows, make sure that the Docker VM has enough memory to run the microservices. The default settings
are usually not enough and make the `docker-compose up` painfully slow.*

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

## In case you find a bug/suggested improvement for Spring Petclinic Microservices

Our issue tracker is available here: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices/issues

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which gets populated at startup with data.
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
Dependency for Connector/J, the MySQL JDBC driver is already included in the `dpom.xml` files.

### Start a MySql database

You may start a MySql database with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```
or download and install the MySQL database (e.g., MySQL Community Server 5.7 GA), which can be found here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

### Use the Spring 'mysql' profile

To use a MySQL database, you have to start 3 microservices (`visits-service`, `customers-service` and `vets-services`)
with the `mysql` Spring profile. Add the `--spring.profiles.active=mysql`` as programm argument.

By default, at startup, database schema will be created and data will be populated.
You may also manualy create the PetClinic database and data by executing the `"db/mysql/{schema,data}.sql"` scripts of each 3 microservices. 
In the `application.yml` of the [Configuration repository], set the `initialization-mode` to `never`.

If you are running the microservices with Docker, you have to add the `mysql` profile into the (Dockerfile)[docker/Dockerfile]:
```
ENV SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE docker,mysql
```
In the `mysql section` of the `application.yml` from the [Configuration repository], you have to change 
the host and port of your MySQL JDBC connection string.
